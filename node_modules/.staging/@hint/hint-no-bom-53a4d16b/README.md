# Warn if the byte-order mark (BOM) character is at beginning of a text file (`no-bom`)

`no-bom` warns against having the byte-order mark (BOM) character
at the beginning of a text file.

## Why is this important?

Having the BOM character at the beginning of a file over the internet
(especially HTML) can have some bad side effects on some browsers.
The BOM character can be used to indicate the charset of the content
is `UTF-8` but this doesn't mean it will be considered. For example,
Internet Explorer 10 and 11 give a higher precedence to the HTTP header
while previous versions gave the precedence to BOM for the encoding.

You can learn about other problems in [this section][bom problems].

## What does the hint check?

This hint checks that all text-based media type files are served
without the BOM character at the beginning.

### Examples that **trigger** the hint

A text file (such as HTML) that starts with the BOM character `U+FEFF`
will fail.

### Examples that **pass** the hint

A text file (such as HTML) that doesn't start with the BOM character
`U+FEFF` will pass.

## How to use this hint?

To use it you will have to install it via `npm`:

```bash
npm install @hint/hint-no-bom
```

Note: You can make `npm` install it as a `devDependency` using the
`--save-dev` parameter, or to install it globally, you can use the
`-g` parameter. For other options see [`npm`'s
documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install).

And then activate it via the [`.hintrc`][hintrc] configuration file:

```json
{
    "connector": {...},
    "formatters": [...],
    "hints": {
        "no-bom": "error",
        ...
    },
    "parsers": [...],
    ...
}
```
